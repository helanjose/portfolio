            <p>Golden Retrievers are a very popular kind of dog. When the breed was first created, they were used for hunting. Now, they are sometimes used for hunting, but a lot of people like to have them as pets because they are very friendly. 
            People also like them because their face looks like they are smiling all the time. Because they are so friendly,
            Golden Retrievers cannot be used as guard dogs, but they are good as drug dogs at airports and very good as service dogs for the blind (People who cannot see). They also like people, so when they are left alone for too long, they get very sad. Golden retrievers make very good pets because they are friendly and playful.The breed is a prominent participant in conformation shows for purebred dogs. The Golden Retriever is popular as a disability assistance dog, such as being a guide dog for the blind and a hearing dog for the deaf. In addition, they are trained to be a hunting dog, a detection dog, and a search and rescue participant. The breed's friendly, gentle temperament means it is unsuited to being a professional guard dog, but its temperament has also made it the third-most popular family dog breed (by registration) in the United States,[6] the fifth-most popular in Brazil[7] and Australia,[8] and the eighth-most popular in the United Kingdom.[9] Golden Retrievers are rarely choosy eaters, but require ample (two or more hours a day) exercise.[10] The breed is fond of play but also highly trainable.</p>
